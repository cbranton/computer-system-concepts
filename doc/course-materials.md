# Computer Systems Concepts Course Materials

## Communication and Collaboration

### Canvas LMS

Canvas has replaced Moodle this year as Drury's learning management system (LMS). You are responsible for any material or assignments posted on Canvas. **I will not always announce in class that an assignment has been posted.**

### Class Discord

We will use Discord for informal communication and information sharing. The class server is at [https://discord.gg/9XK9e2RpTa](https://discord.gg/9XK9e2RpTa)

## Textbooks and needed resources

We will utilize a number of free online resources for this course. You will not be required to purchase a textbook.

 We will be using ["Dive Into Systems"](https://diveintosystems.org/), by Suzanne Matthews, Tia Newhall, and Kevin Webb for several units of the course. A [print version](https://diveintosystems.org/#_print_version) is availabe from No Starch Press. The online version is free to use.

 Our investigation into operating systems takes material from a pair of online texts:

- [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)

- [Operating Systems and MiddleWare: Supporting Controlled Interaction](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/161)


## Arduino electronics

We will begin the semester studying some of the electronics concepts used in computers. Each of you will need tools and components comparable to what is contained in the 
Elegoo Uno Super Starter Kit: https://www.elegoo.com/collections/uno-r3-starter-kits/products/elegoo-uno-project-super-starter-kit 
If you are interested in electronics you might wish to invest in a kit you can keep. Otherwise, we have acquired kits that you can use for the semester. **Students have had mixed results with the 9V batteries that come with the kits, especially those we have had around for a few years. You will want to invest in a new, high quality 9V battery or a barrel connector power supply.**
It is not necessary to have this particular brand or model. Anything with Arduino, bread board, LEDs, buttons, resistors, and some misc. sensors and motors will do. For example, the official Arduino starter kit: https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-starter-kit would work as well.

You will want to download the tutorial manual for the Elegoo kit from their download page. https://www.elegoo.com/download/ Much of our electronics work will be based on the first 10 lessons or so in that document. We can make adjustments for small differences in components.

## C/C++ development

### TODO 
You are not required to have your own computer. However, you will need access to a Unix-like operating system. We have installed the Windows Subsystem for Linux on the lab machines. If wish to use a Windows machine, you may wish to do the same. MacOS qualifies as it is. Access to the GNU C/C++ compiler (gcc) is required. While this can be installed on Windows through Cygwin or MINGW, access to a Unix-like operating system (e.g. Linux) is highly recommended. Windows users may wish to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It is already installed on the lab machines. Mac users already have a Unix machine. Another option would be to use a Raspberry Pi and install one of the Unix-like operating systems available.

There is no required text for this course. We will utilize a number of open source resources.
